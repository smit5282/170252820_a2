    Browser cache is a temporary storage area in memory or on disk that holds the most recently downloaded Web pages. As you jump from Web page to Web page, caching those pages in memory lets you quickly go back to a page without having to download it from the Web again.

    Almost every website on the Internet creates cookies on your computer. These small files contain various information about your actions online, potentially including your account logins, browsing history and active information on sites, such as the items in a Web store's shopping cart. While some sites may use cookies to track your habits for advertising, most exist to simplify your online activities, and deleting them will reset some of your settings.

    If we were to clear the cookies the next time you displayed the webpage, everything must be downloaded anew which means that the email notification pop out would show up again. This allows the user to see it again after visiting the webpage in the past.
